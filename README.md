# 🧑‍⚕️ Hair Loss Prediction
## 📌 Project Overview
Hair loss is a common concern affecting both appearance and overall health. This project analyzes various factors contributing to hair loss, including genetics, hormonal changes, medical conditions, medications, nutrition, and stress levels. The goal is to explore correlations and build predictive models that can aid in health management and medical interventions.

## 📂 Dataset Details
The dataset contains key demographic, health, and lifestyle features related to hair loss.

## 🏆 Descriptive Statistics
At this level, we analyze summary statistics to answer key questions:

- 📌 What is the average age of individuals experiencing hair loss?
- 📌 Which medical conditions are most commonly associated with hair loss?
- 📌 What types of nutritional deficiencies are present, and how frequent are they?

## 📊 Data Visualization
We use charts and plots to uncover trends in hair loss.

- 📌 What percentage of individuals experience hair loss across different age groups?
- 📌 How does hair loss vary with stress levels?

## 🤖  Machine Learning
At this level, we apply predictive modeling to identify key risk factors.

### 📌 Tasks
- 1️⃣ Clustering Analysis - Identify distinct hair loss groups.
- 2️⃣ Decision Trees / Random Forest - Determine key predictors of hair loss.
